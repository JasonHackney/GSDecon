abstract = {We describe cell type-specific significance analysis of microarrays (csSAM) for analyzing differential gene expression for each cell type in a biological sample from microarray data and relative cell-type frequencies. First, we validated csSAM with predesigned mixtures and then applied it to whole-blood gene expression datasets from stable post-transplant kidney transplant recipients and those experiencing acute transplant rejection, which revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes that were otherwise undetectable.},

@article{Abbas2009,
abstract = {Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a complex spectrum of cellular and molecular characteristics including several dramatic changes in the populations of peripheral leukocytes. These changes include general leukopenia, activation of B and T cells, and maturation of granulocytes. The manifestation of SLE in peripheral blood is central to the disease but is incompletely understood. A technique for rigorously characterizing changes in mixed populations of cells, microarray expression deconvolution, has been applied to several areas of biology but not to SLE or to blood. Here we demonstrate that microarray expression deconvolution accurately quantifies the constituents of real blood samples and mixtures of immune-derived cell lines. We characterize a broad spectrum of peripheral leukocyte cell types and states in SLE to uncover novel patterns including: specific activation of NK and T helper lymphocytes, relationships of these patterns to each other, and correlations to clinical variables and measures. The expansion and activation of monocytes, NK cells, and T helper cells in SLE at least partly underlie this disease's prominent interferon signature. These and other patterns of leukocyte dynamics uncovered here correlate with disease severity and treatment, suggest potential new treatments, and extend our understanding of lupus pathology as a complex autoimmune disease involving many arms of the immune system.},

@article{Abbas2005,
abstract = {Immune cell-specific expression is one indication of the importance of a gene's role in the immune response. We have compiled a compendium of microarray expression data for virtually all human genes from six key immune cell types and their activated and differentiated states. Immune Response In Silico (IRIS) is a collection of genes that have been selected for specific expression in immune cells. The expression pattern of IRIS genes recapitulates the phylogeny of immune cells in terms of the lineages of their differentiation. Gene Ontology assignments for IRIS genes reveal significant involvement in inflammation and immunity. Genes encoding CD antigens, cytokines, integrins and many other gene families playing key roles in the immune response are highly represented. IRIS also includes proteins of unknown function and expressed sequence tags that may not represent genes. The predicted cellular localization of IRIS proteins is evenly distributed between cell surface and intracellular compartments, indicating that immune specificity is important at many points in the signaling pathways of the immune response. IRIS provides a resource for further investigation into the function of the immune system and immune diseases.},
