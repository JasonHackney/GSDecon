Title: Deconvolution of cellular proportions in expression data
Version: 2.4.43

Author: Jason A. Hackney
Description: Gene set-based methods for analyzing cellular composition of mixed 
    samples. We summarize expression values from gene sets into a per-sample 
    score, called an eigengene. Eigengenes can be used as covariates in linear 
    modelling, as surrogate variables for differences in cellularity between 
    samples. Alternatively, the eigegenes can be used as the unit of analysis, 
    potentially reducing the burden of multiple testing. The package includes a 
    set of cell- and tissue-specific gene sets.
